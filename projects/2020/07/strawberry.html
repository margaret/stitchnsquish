    <div class="project-title"><h2 id="strawberry">Strawberry</h2></div>

    <p>I freehanded this strawberry after thinking it would be funny to make one the same size as the red triceratops, since those are pretty strawberry-shaped themselves.</p>

    <p>Pictured strawberry is worsted weight acrylic yarn on a 4.0mm hook.</p>

    <div class="pattern-flair"><h3>Pattern</h3></div>

    <p>A rough pattern which I think is about 95% the same as every other strawberry crochet pattern, so I didn't think this was worth fully writing out, these are more notes for myself if I want to try and remake one in the same dimensions.:</p>

    <p>All rows are worked into both loops, as in conventional amigurumi</p>

    <p><strong>increase</strong>: two stitches into one stitch</p>

    <p><strong>sc</strong>: single crochet</p>

    <p><strong>(single crochet 2, increase) * 6 == 24</strong>: "Do the stuff in parentheses 6 times in a row, at the end of this round you should have 24 stitches total"</p>

    <h4>Body</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>With red yarn: single crochet 6 into magic loop == 6</li>
        <li>increase into each stitch == 12</li>
        <li>(sc 1, increase) * 6 == 18</li>
        <li>(sc 2, increase) * 6 == 24</li>
        <li>(sc 3, increase) * 6 == 30</li>
        <li>(sc 4, increase) * 6 == 36</li>
        <li>sc 36</li>
        <li>sc 36 (possibly, I can't remember if I did 1 or two, but it doesn't really matter too much from here on down as long as every other round or so you add in a round that does not decrease)</li>
        <li>Decrease in the reverse pattern of the increases, down to the third-to-last round of 18 stitches. Every other round, or however you feel like it, throw in a round without any decreases so that the overall shape is more conical than spherical.</li>
        <li>Embroider the seeds using a darning needle and a longer beige or light yellow thread than you think you need. You can just knot the start of the embroidry at the center top of the strawberry where the leaves will cover it anyway.</li>
        <li>Stuff</li>
        <li>Continue decreasing to the 12-stitch round and 6-stitch round without throwing in any duplicate rounds. Weave in the ends.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Leaves</h4>

    <p>sc 6 into magic loop, then increase into each stitch for a total of 12 stitches.</p>

    <p>For each leaf, chain 6 or 7 out from the base circle.</p>

    <p>Slip stitch into the second stitch from the hook, then do some combination of single, half-double, and double crochet back to the base of the chain to make a leaf.</p>

    <p>Slip stitch into the next stitch on the base. Chain 6 or 7 out for the next leaf, etc. for a total of 6 leaves. (Each leaf takes up 2 stitches of the base circle's circumference.)</p>

    <p>I varied the leaves because I wanted a more organic look. Keeping the stitches in a given leaf to at most single crochets wide results in a flatter leaf, while using bigger stitches at the base while using 2-3 slip stitch and single crochet at the top results in a curlier leaf.</p>

    <p>Sew leaves onto top with the leaves curling in however it seems easiest to attach it.</p>
