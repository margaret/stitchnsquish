        <p>This was a super fun pattern! I wanted to start with something small, coming back to attempting crochet after over 10 years. (I'd last tried in high school, but I could never quite grok turning, or how to tell which side was the "right" side!)</p>

        <p>Having the video tutorial available definitely helped, especially with the more interesting bits like the bobble stitch legs and picot stitches in the frill that I hadn't done before. Major props to the videography at Club Crochet, as they're one of the clearest video tutorials I've seen.</p>

        <p>However, the pattern I think could benefit from a more liberal usage of parentheses. There are some parts that would have been ambiguous had I not consulted the video, for example when it says <code>(07:04) Rnd 6: sc 6, working in FLO, sc 1, [hdc 1, m.p, hdc 1] repeat 5 times, sc 1 (18 [+5 m.p])</code> am I meant to do the last sc in the front or both loops? Looking back, I think he adds the italicized loop instructions every time you're meant to switch in a row, but it would have been helpful if that was specifically pointed out in the intro.</p>

        <p>I've found that making these out of a stiffer/scratchier yarn results in them having slightly longer snouts. I like being able to get slightly different looks, as it makes them feel more realistic as a group.</p>
        
        <p>I've been making these more or less continuously since the first one since they're so CUTE and can work up in one evening. You can buy one on the <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/StitchNSquish">StitchNSquish Etsy!</a></p>
        
        <p>This is the very first one I made, which I named Pickles ðŸ’•</p>
