    <p>This was a super fun pattern! I wanted to start with something small, coming back to attempting crochet after over 10 years. (I'd last tried in high school, but I could never quite grok turning, or how to tell which side was the "right" side!)</p>
    <p>Having the video tutorial available definitely helped, especially with the more interesting bits like the bobble stitch legs and picot stitches in the frill that I hadn't done before. Big kudos to the videography at Club Crochet, as they're one of the clearest video tutorials I've seen. However, the pattern I think could benefit from a more liberal usage of parentheses. There are some parts that would have been ambiguous had I not consulted the video, for example when it says </p>
    <p>I've found that making these out of a stiffer/scratchier yarn results in them having slightly longer snouts. I like being able to get slightly different looks, as it makes them feel more realistic as a group.</p>
    <p>I've been making these more or less continuously since the first one since they're so CUTE and can work up in one evening. You can buy one on the StitchNSquish Etsy!</p>
    <p>This is the very first one I made, which I named Pickles ðŸ’•</p>
